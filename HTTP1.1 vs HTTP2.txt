    HTTP 
        -stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.
        -It is the method in which computers and servers use to request and send information.
        -The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development,
         this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
        -In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.

    HTTP/1.1
       -Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web.

    HTTP/2
       -HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency
         by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.

    Avantages of HTTP/2.0 OVER HTTP/1.1
        - HTTP/2.0 is much faster and efficient than HTTP/1.1
        - HTTP/2.0 solves several problems comparing HTTP/1.1
        - The reason in which HTTP/2.0 is faster because it prioritizes contents during the loading process 
        - The real difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 comes with server push in which HTTP/2.0 uses only one TCP where as  
          HTTP/1.1 uses two TCP . This mechanism decreases the server work load in HTTP/2.0
