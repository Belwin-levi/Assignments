Difference in behaviour for copying contents in primitive and non primitive datatypes:
  
    -Inorder to understand the difference in behaviourfor copying contents in primitive and non primitive datatypes, we need to understand the datatypes first.
    -In javascript,the data types are categorized into three main types 
           1.Primitive
           2.Trivial
           3.Composite

    -The primitive data types are Numbers, Boolean and String. 
    -The trivial data types include null and undefined, 
    -whereas the composite data types involve objects such as arrays, methods/functions, etc.

     -The primitive data types when copied to another variable,uses “copy by value” whereas non-primitive data types (objects) 
       when copied to another variable, uses “copy by reference”.
   
    Hence,the difference in behaviour for copying contents in primitive and non primitive types is due to copy by value and 
    coby by reference.
