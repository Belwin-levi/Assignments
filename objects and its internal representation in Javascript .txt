Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

  -Objects in javascript is an important datatype and are more complex.
  -Each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. 
  -An object, is a reference data type that is the variables don’t actually store the value. 
  -Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
  -That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.
