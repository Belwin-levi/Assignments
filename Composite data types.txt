Composite Data Types 

     -Objects, Array and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types.
     -In case of composite data type,variable holds reference that is address of that particular value in memory.
 
For example :
     var A=[10,20];
     
        In the above case, the variable A doesn't hold the value 10 and 20 but it holds the address of the value.
